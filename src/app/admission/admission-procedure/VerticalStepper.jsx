          A child is admitted to the School purely on the basis of merit and
          recommendations of any kind debars him from admission. Once the child
          steps inside the gates of the School, the mental as well as the
          physical grooming of the child becomes the responsibility of the
          School. All aspects, like a nutritious healthy diet, hygiene,
          co-curricular activities and sports are all supervised by the
          experienced staff members. Every big and small step leading to the
          child's development is looked upon as an achievement by the School.
