**From the Head's Desk:**

Education is a lifelong process and it begins at school. The purpose of education is to broaden a child's perspective and deepen the understanding of the world. Every child is a unique individual. Today, the role of the school is not only to pursue academic excellence but also to motivate and empower its students to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and productive members of an ever changing global society.

I feel proud to express that the school is moving towards excellence in all the aspects to ensure academic and human excellence with the blessings of Almighty Allah. I pray to Allah that our journey towards progress continues. **"Everything that is done in the world is done by hope"**. As Educators we also ignite hope in the students to explore and fulfill their potentials.

With warm regards and good wishes,

**Hina Adnan**
